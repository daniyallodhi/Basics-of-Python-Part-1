# Basics-of-Python-Part-1
Python is a popular high-level programming language that is widely used for various applications such as web development, data analysis, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. As a beginner, it is essential to learn the basics of Python programming to develop your coding skills.
<br>
This project has helped me learn and practice the basics of Python programming. I have gone through the following concepts and implemented them using code:
<br>
<b>Printing "Hello World": </b>
I learned how to write the traditional "Hello World" program in Python, which prints the text "Hello, World!" on the screen.
<br>
<b>Operators: </b>
I learned about different operators in Python such as arithmetic operators, comparison operators, logical operators, and bitwise operators. I practiced using these operators to perform operations on variables and values.
<br>
<b>Strings: </b>
I learned how to define and manipulate strings in Python. I practiced using various string methods to manipulate strings.
<br>
<b>Variables: </b>
I learned how to declare and initialize variables in Python. I practiced defining variables with different data types.
<br>
<b>Input: </b>
I learned how to get user input in Python using the input function. I practiced using the input function to get input from the user.
<br>
<b>Conditions:</b> 
I learned how to use if-else statements to control the flow of a program in Python. I practiced using if-else statements to execute different code based on certain conditions.
<br>
<b>Loops:</b>
I learned how to use for and while loops to execute code repeatedly in Python. I practiced using loops to iterate through lists and perform operations on each element.
